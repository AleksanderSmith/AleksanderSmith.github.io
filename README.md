### Setup script for development environment
I am currently working on setting up an install script for my environment. I mainly use .NET on windows so currently the script installs the following:

* dotnet core
* powershell core
* chocolatey
* scoop

After scoop is installed I use that to get some other tools I use:

* git
* python
* ack
* nmap
* touch

From here it goes on to install and fix the config for the new Windows terminal.
I have it set up with starhip and the delugia nerd font.

It is still a work in progress and I am currently working on getting it up and running as a gist I can just run on any new windows pc.

I am looking into starting to use windows sandbox for testing and have yet to script install of IDEs and other tools.


My vision is to have the script install everything with flags to allow for excluding certain tools.
